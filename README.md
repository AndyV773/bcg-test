My original design placed the navbar at the bottom of the hero image, but I struggled to get it to work correctly with sticky positioning. This project began as a practice website, so my Git commits were not done as they should have been. I also made a lot of trial-and-error changes to get things working correctly and did not want these reflected in my commit messages. However, I now realize this approach was incorrect. I have since committed my web design and will commit any further changes properly.

The next step is to work on a landing page for the contact.html, so that clients will get a response after filling in the contact form. I will also be making some adjustments to the sizing and positioning of images and text on the service page.

## Installation

There are no specific installation instructions for this project currently.

## Usage

To use the website, simply open it in a web browser. It is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, providing visitors with information about the contractor's services and contact details.
